# FilterThresholds.java - Complete Documentation

This document provides a detailed description of all filter thresholds used in the StockFilterLambda application for earnings calendar spread trading.

## Overview
The `FilterThresholds.java` file serves as the central configuration hub for all filter criteria. It contains thresholds for 6 core filters plus additional configuration parameters for position sizing, portfolio management, and execution logic.

## üìä IV RATIO FILTER THRESHOLDS

- **Constant**: Uses `IV_RATIO_THRESHOLD = 1.20` from core thresholds
- **Purpose**: Ensures earnings-related volatility skew exists
- **Usage**: Applied in `IVRatioFilter.java` and main filter logic
- **Rationale**: Calendar spreads profit from volatility crush, so we need elevated short-term IV

## üí• VOLATILITY CRUSH FILTER THRESHOLDS

### Volatility Crush Threshold
- **Constant**: `VOLATILITY_CRUSH_THRESHOLD = 0.90` (90%)
- **Purpose**: Maximum post-earnings/pre-earnings volatility ratio
- **Usage**: Applied in `StockVolatilityCrushFilter.java` line 31 and `StockFilterLambda.java` line 1144
- **Rationale**: Requires post-earnings volatility to be < 90% of pre-earnings volatility

## üîÑ THRESHOLD UPDATES

The volatility crush thresholds were recently updated based on real-world testing:
- **Previous**: 70% crush percentage, 80% volatility threshold (0% pass rate)
- **Current**: 50% crush percentage, 90% volatility threshold (5.9% pass rate)

This update made the filter more realistic while maintaining its quality standards.

## üìù CONVENIENCE METHODS

The class provides three summary methods for logging and debugging:
- `getCoreThresholdsSummary()`: Volume, IV ratio, ATM thresholds
- `getLiquidityThresholdsSummary()`: Spread, depth, trades, price range
- `getAllThresholdsSummary()`: All major thresholds in one string

---

## üéØ STRATEGY ALIGNMENT

All thresholds are specifically calibrated for **earnings calendar spread trading**:
- **Entry**: 15 minutes before market close (day before earnings)
- **Exit**: 15 minutes after market open (day after earnings)
- **Structure**: Sell short-term calls, buy long-term calls
- **Profit Source**: Volatility crush and time decay

The thresholds ensure only high-quality, liquid stocks with favorable volatility patterns are selected for this specific strategy.
